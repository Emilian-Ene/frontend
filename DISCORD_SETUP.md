# Discord Integration Setup

## Steps to Complete Discord Integration:

### 1. Create Discord Server (if you don't have one)
- Go to Discord and create a new server
- Name it "TOPC Trading Community" or similar
- Set up recommended channels:
  - #welcome (read-only announcements)
  - #rules (community guidelines)
  - #announcements (updates from TOPC team)
  - #general-chat (community discussion)
  - #how-to (ask questions and get help)
  - #reviews-and-feedback (share your TOPC experience)
  - #trading-strategies (discuss trading approaches)
  - #success-stories (share your wins)

### 2. Create Invite Link
- In Discord, click your server name
- Click "Invite People"
- Click "Edit invite link"
- Set to "Never Expire"
- Set "Max number of uses" to "No limit"
- Copy the invite link (e.g., https://discord.gg/ABC123XYZ)

### 3. Update Your Website
Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE` in **index.html** with your actual Discord invite code:

**Line 678:** Discord Review Section button
```html
href="https://discord.gg/YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE"
```

**Line 267:** Header Community button
```html
href="https://discord.gg/YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE"
```

**Line 346:** Mobile menu Discord button
```html
href="https://discord.gg/YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE"
```

### 4. Example
If your Discord invite is: `https://discord.gg/topc-trading`

Change:
```html
href="https://discord.gg/YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE"
```

To:
```html
href="https://discord.gg/topc-trading"
```
